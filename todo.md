- [x] add health data to system
- [x] add track heading and speed for drone
- [ ] entity grouping for drone, pilot, home
- [ ] add signal frequency based on sdr selection
- [ ] add range rings around system and/or pilot location for common ranges (or let lattice operator do it)
- [ ] map symbololgy sidc based on tak symbol
- [ ] add payloads for system components?
- [ ] drone, pilot, home `relationship...tracked by` link to system
- [ ] `createdTime` based on first seen if possible
